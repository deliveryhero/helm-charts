    #   # 'source' and 'target' are both required and describe the source and

    #   #  - 'registry' points to the server; required
    #   #  - 'auth' contains the base64 encoded credentials for the registry
    #   #    in JSON form {"username": "...", "password": "..."}
    #   #  - 'auth-refresh' specifies an interval for automatic retrieval of
    #   #    credentials; only for AWS ECR (see below)
    #   #  - 'skip-tls-verify' determines whether to skip TLS verification for the
    #   #    registry server (only for 'skopeo', see note below); defaults to false

    #     registry: source-registry.acme.com

    #   # 'mappings' is a list of 'from':'to' pairs that define mappings of image
    #   # paths in the source registry to paths in the destination:

    #   #     the same as 'from'.
    #   #  - Regular expressions are supported in both fields (read on below for
    #   #    more details).
    #   #  - The tags being synced for a mapping can be limited by providing a 'tags'
    #   #    list. This list may contain semver and regular expressions filters
    #   #    (see below). When omitted, all image tags are synced.
    #   #  - With 'platform', the image to sync from a multi-platform source image
    #   #    can be selected (see below).
    #   mappings:
    #     - from: test/image
