  A service virtualization tool (some call it mock server) for testing purposes.

  This is a templated deployment of [WireMock](http://wiremock.org/) for mocking services during test scenario execution
  for load tests as well as for manual and automated QA purposes.

  By default the chart will install WireMock with only a `/status` mapping for readiness probes.

  One can utilize it's HTTP API as well as the file configuration documented in the
  [Running as a Standalone Process](http://wiremock.org/docs/running-standalone/) described in the "Configuring via JSON
  over HTTP" and "JSON file configuration" chapters.

  The JSON file configuration is the recommended setup and the [stub mappings](http://wiremock.org/docs/stubbing/)
  should be provided in `ConfigMap`s one per folder.

  > :warning: both folders `mappings` and `__files` are optional but each folder requires it's own `ConfigMap`. The
  `-mappings` and `-files` suffixes are obligate.

  ```console
  kubectl create configmap my-service1-stubs-mappings --from-file=path/to/your/service1/mappings
  kubectl create configmap my-service1-stubs-files --from-file=path/to/your/service1/__files

  kubectl create configmap my-service2-stubs-mappings --from-file=path/to/your/service2/mappings
  kubectl create configmap my-service2-stubs-files --from-file=path/to/your/service2/__files
  ```

  Install the chart passing the `stubs` as a value omitting the suffixes as both `mappings` and `__files` folders are
  handled transparently during initialization depending on their existence.

  ```console
  helm install my-wiremock deliveryhero/wiremock \
    --set consumer=my-consumer
    --set "consumer.stubs.my-service1-stubs=/mnt/my-service1-stubs" \
    --set "consumer.stubs.my-service2-stubs=/mnt/my-service2-stubs"
  ```

  WireMock's [admin API](http://wiremock.org/docs/api/) is not publicly exposed, but can be accessed using port forwarding.

  ```console
  kubectl port-forward my-wiremock-123456789a-bcdef 8080
  ```

  The HTTP API can then be accessed using `http://localhost:8080/__admin/docs/` where a swagger UI is availabe.

  > :warning: this does not work out for multi instance setups as there is no synchronization of mappings created using
  the HTTP API between multiple instances.

  In case JSON files need to be provided, which are too large for usual `ConfigMap`s, one can define a binary config map
  with a zip archive that contains the file in question.

  ```console
  gzip large.json
  kubectl create configmap my-binary-stub --from-file=large.json.gz
  ```

  The resulting archive can be best installed in the wiremock using a `values.yaml` file.

  ```yaml
  consumer:
    initContainer:
    - name: unzip-large-file
      image: busybox:latest
      command: ["sh", "-c", "cp /archive/large.json.gz /working/mappings; gunzip /working/mappings/large.json.gz"]
      volumeMounts:
      - mountPath: /working
        name: working
      - mountPath: /archive
        name: my-binary-stub
    initVolume:
    - name: my-binary-stub
      configMap:
        name: my-binary-stub
  ```
