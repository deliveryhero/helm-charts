description: |
  A TCP proxy to simulate network and system conditions for chaos and resiliency testing.

  By default the chart will install toxiproxy with blank configuration. You can add [toxics](https://github.com/Shopify/toxiproxy#toxics) to the running configuration using the [API](https://github.com/Shopify/toxiproxy#http-api).

  For large configurations it is easier to store your toxics in a JSON file, in a `ConfigMap` and pass this to the chart to be used by toxiproxy:

  ```console
  kubectl create configmap my-toxiproxy-config --from-file path/to/your/toxiproxy.json
  ```

  And then install the chart passing the name of the `ConfigMap` as a value:

  ```console
  helm install toxiproxy deliveryhero/toxiproxy --set toxiproxyConfig=my-toxiproxy-config
  ```
